This repo accompanies the paper "Nonlinear transport coefficients from large deviation functions" by Chloe Ya Gao and David T. Limmer.

Prerequisites: Cloning algorithm codes in this repo call the gsl library.

Description:

1. ratchet.py: a python code that calculates LDF and extracts transport coefficients for the ratchet model
 
2. FPUT.cpp: cloning algorithm for FPUT model

3. tracer.cpp: cloning algorithm for tracer model

4. data.xslx: calculated LDF and nonequilibrium currents for FPUT and tracer model
